2040 is a turn based strategy game currently being written in python/pygame. 

By design the game is not written in an object oriented style. It uses a combination of imperetive and functional code.

This is a long-term project, its main purpose is to play around with the implementation of various AI algorithms in python.

The finished game will allow players to play as a country and build wealth, technology, and military might to engage in war against other countries. Similar to games like Civilization or Europa Universalis, except more focused on modern warfare.
